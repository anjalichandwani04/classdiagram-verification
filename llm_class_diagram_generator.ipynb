    "Problem Specification : Library Domain Model describes main classes and relationships which could be used during analysis phase to better understand domain area for Integrated Library System (ILS), also known as a Library Management System (LMS).\n",
    "Each physical library item - book, tape cassette, CD, DVD, etc. could have its own item number. To support it, the items may be barcoded. The purpose of barcoding is to provide a unique and scannable identifier that links the barcoded physical item to the electronic record in the catalog. Barcode must be physically attached to the item, and barcode number is entered into the corresponding field in the electronic item record.\n",
    "Barcodes on library items could be replaced by RFID tags. The RFID tag can contain item's identifier, title, material type, etc. It is read by an RFID reader, without the need to open a book cover or CD/DVD case to scan it with barcode reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "Library book attributes ISBN and subject are inherited from Book and shown with prepended caret '^' symbol.\n",
    "The title attribute explicitly redefines name. While type of the attributes is the same, name is different. The lang attribute is explicitly redefined with different type. Original type was free text String, while redefined attribute is more specific (e.g. enumerated) Language class. We used explicit redefinition in this case because attribute types String and Language are not related. Language is enumeration type.\n",
    "Library has some rules on what could be borrowed and what is for reference only. Rules are also defined on how many books could be borrowed by patrons and how many could be reserved.\n",
    "Library book attributes loanPeriod, dueDate, and isOverdue are derived. Length of time a library book may be borrowed (loan period) depends on library policy and varies based on a kind of book and who is borrowing it. For example, in a university library undergraduates could borrow book for 30 days, graduate students for a quarter, and faculty staff for a year. In a public library normal loan period for a book could be 3 weeks, while it could be lowered to 2 weeks for new books. Book return due date will be calculated based on the borrow date and loan period. If due date is past the current date, isOverdue Boolean flag which is false by default will be set to true.\n",
    "Library Catalog provides access for the library patrons and staff to all sources of information about library items, allows to search by a particular author, on a particular topic, or in a particular format, that the library has. It tells the user where materials meeting their specific needs can be found.\n",

The purpose of the diagram is to show and explain hospital structure, staff, relationships with patients, and patient treatment terminology.\n",
    "On the diagram below a Person could be associated with different Hospitals, and a Hospital could employ or serve multiple Persons. Person class has derived attributes name and homeAddress. Name represents full name and could be combined from title, given (or first) name, middle name, and family (or last) name.

    "Ward is a division of a hospital or a suite of rooms shared by patients who need a similar kind of care. In a hospital, there are a number of wards, each of which may be empty or have on it one or more patients. Each ward has a unique name. Diagram below shows it using {id} modifier for ward's name.\n",
    "Wards are differentiated by gender of its patients, i.e. male wards and female wards. A ward can only have patients of the gender admitted to it. Gender is shown as enumeration. Ward and patient have constraint on Gender.\n",
    "Every ward has a fixed capacity, which is the maximum number of patients that can be on it at one time (i.e. the capacity is the number of beds in the ward). Different wards may have different capacities.\n",
    "The doctors in the hospital are organised into teams (also called firms). Each team has a unique name or code (e.g. Orthopaedics or Pediatrics) and is headed by a consultant doctor (in the UK, Republic of Ireland, and parts of the Commonwealth) or attending physician (also known as staff physician) (in the United States). Consultant doctor or attending physician is the senior doctor who has completed all of his or her specialist training, residency and practices medicine in a clinic or hospital, in the specialty learned during residency. She or he can supervise fellows, residents, and medical students. The rest of the team are all junior doctors. Each doctor could be a member of no more than one team.\n",
    "Each patient is on a single ward and is under the care of a single team of doctors. A patient may be treated by any number of doctors but they must all be in the team that cares for the patient. A doctor can treat any number of patients.
