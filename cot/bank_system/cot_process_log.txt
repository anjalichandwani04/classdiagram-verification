PROJECT: Bank System
REQ:
A bank system contains data on customers (identified by name and address) and their accounts. Each account has a balance and there are 2 type of accounts: one for savings which offers an interest rate, the other for investments, used to buy stocks. Stocks are bought at a certain quantity for a certain price (ticker) and the bank applies commission on stock orders.


==================== Step 1: Identify Classes ====================
Based on the provided description, here are the main classes/entities identified, along with justifications for each:

1. **Customer**
   - Justification: Represents individuals who hold accounts in the bank. Identified by attributes such as name and address.

2. **Account**
   - Justification: A general representation of a financial account held by a customer. It has attributes like balance and can be specialized into different types of accounts.

3. **SavingsAccount**
   - Justification: A specific type of account that offers an interest rate. It is a subclass of Account, distinguishing it from other account types.

4. **InvestmentAccount**
   - Justification: Another specific type of account used for buying stocks. It is also a subclass of Account, highlighting its unique purpose.

5. **Stock**
   - Justification: Represents the financial instruments that can be bought and sold within the investment accounts. It includes attributes like quantity and price (ticker).

6. **Commission**
   - Justification: Represents the fee applied by the bank on stock orders. It is an important entity that affects the transactions made in the investment accounts.

These classes encapsulate the key entities and concepts within the bank system as described, focusing on the real-world entities involved in banking operations.


==================== Step 2: Attributes & Methods ====================
Based on the identified classes and their descriptions, here are the attributes and methods for each class:

### 1. **Customer**
- **Attributes:**
  - `name: String`
  - `address: String`
  - `customerID: String` (unique identifier for the customer)
  
- **Methods:**
  - `getName(): String`
  - `getAddress(): String`
  - `updateAddress(newAddress: String): void`
  - `getCustomerID(): String`

### 2. **Account**
- **Attributes:**
  - `balance: Double`
  - `accountNumber: String` (unique identifier for the account)
  - `accountType: String` (e.g., "Savings", "Investment")
  
- **Methods:**
  - `getBalance(): Double`
  - `deposit(amount: Double): void`
  - `withdraw(amount: Double): void`
  - `getAccountNumber(): String`
  - `getAccountType(): String`

### 3. **SavingsAccount** (inherits from Account)
- **Attributes:**
  - `interestRate: Double`
  
- **Methods:**
  - `calculateInterest(): Double` (calculates interest based on the balance)
  - `applyInterest(): void` (applies interest to the balance)

### 4. **InvestmentAccount** (inherits from Account)
- **Attributes:**
  - `stocks: List<Stock>` (a list of stocks held in the account)
  
- **Methods:**
  - `buyStock(stock: Stock, quantity: int): void` (buys a specified quantity of a stock)
  - `sellStock(stock: Stock, quantity: int): void` (sells a specified quantity of a stock)
  - `getStocks(): List<Stock>` (returns the list of stocks in the account)

### 5. **Stock**
- **Attributes:**
  - `ticker: String` (the stock symbol)
  - `quantity: int` (the number of shares owned)
  - `price: Double` (the current price per share)
  
- **Methods:**
  - `getTicker(): String`
  - `getQuantity(): int`
  - `getPrice(): Double`
  - `updatePrice(newPrice: Double): void` (updates the price of the stock)

### 6. **Commission**
- **Attributes:**
  - `rate: Double` (the commission rate as a percentage)
  
- **Methods:**
  - `calculateCommission(amount: Double): Double` (calculates the commission based on the transaction amount)
  - `getRate(): Double`

These attributes and methods provide a structured way to represent the entities and their behaviors within the banking system, allowing for effective management of customer accounts and transactions.


==================== Step 3: Relationships ====================
Based on the provided classes and their descriptions, here are the identified relationships along with their types and cardinalities:

1. **Customer -- Association -- Account** : 1..*  
   - A customer can have multiple accounts, but each account is associated with exactly one customer.

2. **Account -- Inheritance -- SavingsAccount** : 1  
   - SavingsAccount is a specialized type of Account. Each SavingsAccount is an Account, but not all Accounts are SavingsAccounts.

3. **Account -- Inheritance -- InvestmentAccount** : 1  
   - InvestmentAccount is another specialized type of Account. Each InvestmentAccount is an Account, but not all Accounts are InvestmentAccounts.

4. **InvestmentAccount -- Aggregation -- Stock** : 0..*  
   - An InvestmentAccount can hold multiple Stocks, but a Stock can exist independently of an InvestmentAccount (it can be bought or sold).

5. **Commission -- Association -- InvestmentAccount** : 0..*  
   - An InvestmentAccount may incur multiple commissions based on stock transactions, but a commission is not tied to a specific InvestmentAccount unless a transaction occurs.

6. **Stock -- Association -- Commission** : 0..*  
   - A Stock can be associated with multiple commissions (for different transactions), but a commission is related to a specific stock transaction.

These relationships help to define how the classes interact with each other within the banking system.
