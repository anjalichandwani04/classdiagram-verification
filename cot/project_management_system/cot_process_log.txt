PROJECT: Project Management System
REQ:
A project manager uses the project management system to manage a project. The project manager leads a team to execute the project within the project's start and end dates. Once a project is created in the project management system, a manager may initiate and later terminate the project due to its completion or for some other reason. As input, a project uses requirements. As output, a project produces a system (or part of a system). The requirements and system are work products: things that are created, used, updated, and elaborated on throughout a project. Every work product has a description, is of some percent complete throughout the effort, and may be validated. However, validation is dependent on the type of work product. For example, the requirements are validated with users in workshops, and the system is validated by being tested against the requirements. Furthermore, requirements may be published using various types of media, including on an intranet or in paper form; and systems may be deployed onto specific platforms.


==================== Step 1: Identify Classes ====================
Based on the provided description, here are the main classes/entities identified, along with justifications for each:

1. **Project Manager**
   - Justification: This entity represents the individual responsible for overseeing and managing the project, making it a key role in the project management system.

2. **Project**
   - Justification: The central entity that encompasses the entire effort, including its start and end dates, and is subject to initiation and termination.

3. **Team**
   - Justification: Refers to the group of individuals working under the project manager to execute the project, highlighting the collaborative aspect of project management.

4. **Requirements**
   - Justification: These are the inputs for the project that define what needs to be accomplished, making them a critical component of the project lifecycle.

5. **System**
   - Justification: Represents the output of the project, which is the end product or part of a product that is developed based on the requirements.

6. **Work Product**
   - Justification: A general term that encompasses both requirements and systems, indicating items that are created, used, updated, and validated throughout the project.

7. **Description**
   - Justification: This refers to the textual or documented explanation of a work product, which is essential for understanding its purpose and scope.

8. **Percent Complete**
   - Justification: Represents the progress metric for work products, indicating how much of the work has been completed at any given time.

9. **Validation**
   - Justification: This entity represents the process of confirming that a work product meets its requirements, which is crucial for ensuring quality.

10. **Media**
    - Justification: Refers to the various forms through which requirements can be published, such as intranet or paper, highlighting the communication aspect of project management.

11. **Platform**

Based on the provided description and the identified classes, here are the relationships between the classes, along with their types and cardinalities:

1. **Project Manager** -- **Manages** -- **Project** : 1..*  
   - A project manager can manage multiple projects, but each project is managed by one project manager.

2. **Project** -- **Contains** -- **Team** : 1..1  
   - Each project has exactly one team assigned to it, and a team is dedicated to one project.

3. **Project** -- **Uses** -- **Requirements** : 0..*  
   - A project can have zero or more requirements, but requirements can exist independently of a project.

   - A project may produce one system as its output, but it is possible for a project not to produce a system.

5. **Requirements** -- **Is a** -- **Work Product** : 1..1  
   - Each requirement is a type of work product.

6. **System** -- **Is a** -- **Work Product** : 1..1  
   - Each system is also a type of work product.

7. **Work Product** -- **Has** -- **Description** : 1..1  
   - Every work product has exactly one description.
