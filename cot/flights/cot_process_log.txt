PROJECT: Flights
REQ:
We want to model a system for management of flights and pilots. An airline operates flights. Each airline has an ID. Each flight has an ID a departure airport and an arrival airport: an airport as a unique identifier. Each flight has a pilot and a co-pilot, and it uses an aircraft of a certain type; a flight has also a departure time and an arrival time. An airline owns a set of aircrafts of different types. An aircraft can be in a working state or it can be under repair. In a particular moment an aircraft can be landed or airborne. A company has a set of pilots: each pilot has an experience level: 1 is minimum, 3 is maximum. A type of aeroplane may need a particular number of pilots, with a different role (e.g.: captain, co-pilot, navigator): there must be at least one captain and one co-pilot, and a captain must have a level 3.


==================== Step 1: Identify Classes ====================
Based on the provided description, the following main classes/entities can be identified:

1. **Airline**
   - Justification: Represents the organization that operates flights. It has a unique identifier (ID) and owns a set of aircraft.

2. **Flight**
   - Justification: Represents a specific journey operated by an airline. It has unique attributes such as an ID, departure and arrival airports, departure and arrival times, and is associated with a pilot and co-pilot.

3. **Airport**
   - Justification: Represents the locations where flights depart from and arrive at. Each airport has a unique identifier.

4. **Pilot**
   - Justification: Represents individuals who operate the flights. Each pilot has an experience level and can have different roles (e.g., captain, co-pilot).

5. **Co-Pilot**
   - Justification: A specific role of a pilot who assists the captain during the flight. This role is distinct but still falls under the broader category of Pilot.

6. **Aircraft**
   - Justification: Represents the physical planes used for flights. Each aircraft has a type and can be in different states (working or under repair) and statuses (landed or airborne).

7. **Experience Level**
   - Justification: Represents the proficiency of pilots, which is categorized into levels (1 to 3). This can be modeled as an attribute of the Pilot class.

8. **Aeroplane Type**
   - Justification: Represents the classification of aircraft that may require a specific number of pilots with different roles. This is important for understanding the operational requirements of different aircraft.

These classes encapsulate the key entities and relationships described in the system for managing flights and pilots, focusing on the real-world aspects without delving into implementation details.

This structure provides a clear representation of the classes, their attributes, and methods, allowing for effective management of flights and pilots within the system.


==================== Step 3: Relationships ====================
Based on the provided description and the identified classes, here are the relationships between the classes, their types, and cardinalities:

1. **Airline** -- Aggregation -- **Aircraft** : 1..*  
   - An airline owns multiple aircraft, but an aircraft can exist independently of an airline.

2. **Airline** -- Aggregation -- **Pilot** : 1..*  
   - An airline employs multiple pilots, but a pilot can exist independently of an airline.

3. **Flight** -- Association -- **Airport** : 2 (1 departure airport, 1 arrival airport)  
   - A flight is associated with one departure airport and one arrival airport.

4. **Flight** -- Association -- **Pilot** : 1  
   - A flight has one pilot.

5. **Flight** -- Association -- **Co-Pilot** : 1  
   - A flight has one co-pilot.

6. **Flight** -- Association -- **Aircraft** : 1  
   - A flight uses one aircraft.

7. **Pilot** -- Inheritance -- **Co-Pilot** : 1  
   - A co-pilot is a specialized type of pilot.

8. **Pilot** -- Association -- **Experience Level** : 1  
   - Each pilot has one experience level.

9. **Aircraft** -- Association -- **Aeroplane Type** : 1  
   - Each aircraft is of one aeroplane type.

10. **Aeroplane Type** -- Association -- **Pilot** : 1..*  
    - An aeroplane type may require multiple pilots (with different roles), but each pilot is associated with one aeroplane type.

### Summary of Relationships:
- **Airline** -- Aggregation -- **Aircraft** : 1..*
- **Airline** -- Aggregation -- **Pilot** : 1..*
- **Flight** -- Association -- **Airport** : 2 (1 departure, 1 arrival)
- **Flight** -- Association -- **Pilot** : 1
- **Flight** -- Association -- **Co-Pilot** : 1
- **Flight** -- Association -- **Aircraft** : 1

- **Pilot** -- Association -- **Experience Level** : 1
- **Aircraft** -- Association -- **Aeroplane Type** : 1
- **Aeroplane Type** -- Association -- **Pilot** : 1..* 

This structure captures the relationships and cardinalities effectively, reflecting the management system for flights and pilots.
