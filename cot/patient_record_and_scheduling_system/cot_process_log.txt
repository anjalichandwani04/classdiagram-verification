PROJECT: Patient Record and Scheduling System
REQ:
A patient record and scheduling system in a doctor’s office is used by the receptionists, nurses, and doctors. The receptionists use the system to enter new patient information when first-time patients visit the doctor. They also schedule all appointments. The nurses use the system to keep track of the results of each visit including diagnosis and medications. For each visit, free form text fields are used captures information on diagnosis and treatment. Multiple medications may be prescribed during each visit. The nurses can also access the information to print out a history of patient visits. The doctors primarily use the system to view patient history. The doctors may enter some patient treatment information and prescriptions occasionally, but most frequently they let the nurses enter this information. -- Each patient is assigned to a family. The head of family is responsible for the person with the primary medical coverage. Information about doctors is maintained since a family has a primary care physician, but different doctors may be the ones seeing the patient during the visit.


==================== Step 1: Identify Classes ====================
Based on the provided description, here are the main classes/entities identified, along with justifications for each:

1. **Patient**
   - Justification: Represents individuals receiving medical care. The system tracks their information, visit history, and treatment details.

2. **Family**
   - Justification: Represents a group of patients, with a head of family responsible for medical coverage. This entity helps in organizing patients under a common household.

3. **Doctor**
   - Justification: Represents medical professionals who provide care to patients. The system maintains information about doctors, including their roles as primary care physicians.

4. **Receptionist**
   - Justification: Represents staff members who manage patient information and appointments. They are key users of the system for entering new patient data and scheduling.

5. **Nurse**
   - Justification: Represents healthcare professionals who track patient visits, diagnoses, and medications. They play a crucial role in managing patient records and treatment information.

6. **Appointment**
   - Justification: Represents scheduled visits between patients and doctors. This entity is essential for managing the timing and organization of patient care.

7. **Visit**
   - Justification: Represents individual instances of patient consultations with healthcare providers. Each visit includes details such as diagnosis, treatment, and medications prescribed.

8. **Diagnosis**
   - Justification: Represents the identification of a medical condition based on patient visits. It is a key component of patient records and treatment plans.

9. **Medication**
   - Justification: Represents prescribed drugs for patients. Multiple medications can be associated with a single visit, making this entity important for treatment tracking.

10. **Treatment**
    - Justification: Represents the care provided to patients during visits, including procedures and therapies. It is essential for documenting patient care.

11. **Patient History**
    - Justification: Represents the cumulative record of a patient's visits, diagnoses, and treatments over time. This is crucial for doctors to review prior to consultations.

These classes/entities encapsulate the key components of the patient record and scheduling system, focusing on the real-world entities involved in the healthcare process described.
