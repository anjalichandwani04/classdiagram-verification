PROJECT: Veterinary Clinic
REQ:
The owner of a veterinary clinic wants to create a database to store information about all veterinary services performed. After some research he came up with the following requirements: ● For each admitted animal, its name, breed (if any) and owner must be stored. Each animal should be given an unique numeric identifier. ● For each owner, its name, address and phone number should be stored. An unique numeric identifier should also be generated for each one of them. ● An animal might be owner-less. This happens frequently as the clinic often rescues abandoned dogs from the streets in order to treat them and get them new owners. ● It should be possible to store information about a specific breed even if no animals of that breed have been treated at the clinic. ● Each appointement always has a responsible physician. All appointements start at a certain date and time; and are attended by an animal (and of course its owner). ● For each physician, his name, address and phone number should be stored. An unique numeric identifier should also be generated for each one of them. ● In an appointement, several medical conditions might be detected. Each condition has a common name and a scientific name. No two conditions have the same scientific name. ● It should be possible to store information about the most common conditions for each different breed in the database.


==================== Step 1: Identify Classes ====================
Based on the provided description, here are the main classes/entities identified, along with justifications for each:

1. **Animal**
   - Justification: Represents the animals admitted to the veterinary clinic. Each animal has attributes like name, breed, and a unique identifier.

2. **Owner**
   - Justification: Represents the owners of the animals. Each owner has attributes such as name, address, phone number, and a unique identifier. The owner can also be absent for certain animals.

3. **Breed**
   - Justification: Represents the different breeds of animals. This class is necessary to store information about breeds, even if no animals of that breed are currently treated at the clinic.

4. **Appointment**
   - Justification: Represents the scheduled visits to the clinic. Each appointment is associated with a specific animal, its owner, and a responsible physician, along with a date and time.

5. **Physician**
   - Justification: Represents the veterinarians or doctors responsible for treating the animals. Each physician has attributes like name, address, phone number, and a unique identifier.

6. **MedicalCondition**
   - Justification: Represents the various medical conditions that can be detected during an appointment. Each condition has a common name and a scientific name, with the requirement that no two conditions share the same scientific name.

7. **CommonCondition**
   - Justification: Represents the common medical conditions associated with specific breeds. This class is necessary to link breeds with their common medical conditions.

These classes encapsulate the key entities and relationships described in the requirements for the veterinary clinic's database.


==================== Step 2: Attributes & Methods ====================
Based on the identified classes for the veterinary clinic's database, here are the attributes and methods for each class:

This structure provides a clear representation of the attributes and methods for each class, allowing for effective management of the veterinary clinic's database.


==================== Step 3: Relationships ====================
Based on the provided classes and their descriptions, here are the identified relationships along with their types and cardinalities:

1. **Animal** -- **Association** -- **Owner** : 0..1
   - Justification: An animal can have an owner, but it can also be owner-less (e.g., abandoned animals).

2. **Animal** -- **Association** -- **Breed** : 0..1
   - Justification: An animal may have a breed, but it is not mandatory (e.g., mixed-breed or unknown).

3. **Owner** -- **Aggregation** -- **Animal** : 1..*
   - Justification: An owner can have multiple animals, but each animal can only have one owner (if it has one).

4. **Appointment** -- **Association** -- **Animal** : 1
   - Justification: Each appointment is associated with exactly one animal.

5. **Appointment** -- **Association** -- **Owner** : 1
   - Justification: Each appointment is associated with the owner of the animal, which is mandatory for the appointment.

6. **Appointment** -- **Association** -- **Physician** : 1
   - Justification: Each appointment must have one responsible physician.

7. **Appointment** -- **Aggregation** -- **MedicalCondition** : 0..*
   - Justification: An appointment can have multiple medical conditions detected, but it can also have none.

8. **Breed** -- **Aggregation** -- **CommonCondition** : 1..*
   - Justification: Each breed can have multiple common medical conditions associated with it, but each common condition is linked to one breed.

9. **CommonCondition** -- **Association** -- **MedicalCondition** : 1
   - Justification: Each common condition is associated with exactly one medical condition.

### Summary of Relationships:
- **Animal** -- **Association** -- **Owner** : 0..1
- **Animal** -- **Association** -- **Breed** : 0..1
- **Owner** -- **Aggregation** -- **Animal** : 1..*
- **Appointment** -- **Association** -- **Animal** : 1
- **Appointment** -- **Association** -- **Owner** : 1
- **Appointment** -- **Association** -- **Physician** : 1
- **Appointment** -- **Aggregation** -- **MedicalCondition** : 0..*
- **Breed** -- **Aggregation** -- **CommonCondition** : 1..*
- **CommonCondition** -- **Association** -- **MedicalCondition** : 1

This structure captures the relationships and cardinalities effectively, reflecting the requirements of the veterinary clinic's database.
