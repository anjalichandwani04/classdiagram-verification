PROJECT: Furniture
REQ:
The known furniture factory Hi-Key-Ah, intends to implement an information system to store all data on the different types of furniture and components it produces: ● The factory produces several lines of furniture, each with a different name and consisting of several pieces of furniture of different types (beds, tables, chairs, …). ● All furniture pieces have a type, a single reference (eg CC6578) and a selling price. ● The major competitive advantage of this innovative plant is the fact that each component produced can be used in more than one piece of furniture. ● Each piece of furniture is thus composed of several components. The same component can be used more than once in the same piece. ● Every type of component produced is assigned a unique numerical code, a manufacturing price and a type (screw, hinge, shelf …). ● The furniture is then sold in various stores throughout the world. Each store has a different address and a fax number. ● To make the manufacturing process more efficient, stores have to place orders everytime they need to replenish their stock. These orders must also be stored in the database. ● Each order has a order number, a date, the store that placed the order as well as a list of all the ordered furniture and their quantities.


==================== Step 1: Identify Classes ====================
Based on the provided description, here are the main classes/entities identified, along with justifications for each:

1. **FurnitureLine**
   - Justification: Represents the different lines of furniture produced by the factory, each with a unique name and consisting of various pieces of furniture.

2. **FurniturePiece**
   - Justification: Represents individual pieces of furniture (e.g., beds, tables, chairs) that belong to a furniture line. Each piece has a type, reference, and selling price.

3. **Component**
   - Justification: Represents the individual components (e.g., screws, hinges, shelves) used to assemble furniture pieces. Each component has a unique numerical code, manufacturing price, and type.

4. **Store**
   - Justification: Represents the various stores that sell the furniture. Each store has a unique address and fax number.

5. **Order**
   - Justification: Represents the orders placed by stores to replenish their stock. Each order has an order number, date, associated store, and a list of ordered furniture pieces with their quantities.

6. **OrderItem**
   - Justification: Represents the individual items within an order, detailing the specific furniture pieces ordered and their quantities. This class helps manage the relationship between orders and the furniture pieces.

These classes encapsulate the key entities and relationships described in the furniture factory's information system, focusing on the real-world aspects without delving into implementation specifics.

  - `faxNumber: String` - The fax number of the store.

- **Methods:**
  - `getAddress(): String` - Returns the address of the store.
  - `getFaxNumber(): String` - Returns the fax number of the store.
  - `updateAddress(newAddress: String): void` - Updates the address of the store.

### 5. **Order**
- **Attributes:**
  - `orderNumber: String` - A unique identifier for the order.
  - `date: Date` - The date when the order was placed.
  - `store: Store` - The store that placed the order.
  - `orderItems: List<OrderItem>` - A list of items in the order.

- **Methods:**
  - `addOrderItem(item: OrderItem): void` - Adds an order item to the order.
  - `removeOrderItem(item: OrderItem): void` - Removes an order item from the order.
  - `getOrderItems(): List<OrderItem>` - Returns the list of order items.

### 6. **OrderItem**
- **Attributes:**
  - `furniturePiece: FurniturePiece` - The specific furniture piece ordered.
  - `quantity: int` - The quantity of the furniture piece ordered.

- **Methods:**
  - `getFurniturePiece(): FurniturePiece` - Returns the furniture piece associated with the order item.
  - `getQuantity(): int` - Returns the quantity of the furniture piece ordered.
  - `setQuantity(newQuantity: int): void` - Updates the quantity of the furniture piece ordered.

These attributes and methods provide a structured way to represent the entities and their behaviors in the furniture factory's information system.


==================== Step 3: Relationships ====================
Based on the provided classes and their descriptions, here are the identified relationships, their types, and cardinalities:

1. **FurnitureLine** -- **Aggregation** -- **FurniturePiece** : **1..***
   - A FurnitureLine can contain multiple FurniturePieces, but a FurniturePiece belongs to exactly one FurnitureLine.

2. **FurniturePiece** -- **Composition** -- **Component** : **0..*** 
   - A FurniturePiece is composed of multiple Components, and a Component can be used in multiple FurniturePieces. However, a FurniturePiece can exist without Components (e.g., if it is not yet assembled).

3. **Store** -- **Association** -- **Order** : **1..***
   - A Store can place multiple Orders, but each Order is associated with exactly one Store.

4. **Order** -- **Aggregation** -- **OrderItem** : **1..***
   - An Order consists of multiple OrderItems, and each OrderItem is associated with exactly one Order.

5. **OrderItem** -- **Association** -- **FurniturePiece** : **1**
   - Each OrderItem corresponds to exactly one FurniturePiece, but a FurniturePiece can appear in multiple OrderItems across different Orders.

In summary, the relationships can be listed as follows:

1. **FurnitureLine** -- **Aggregation** -- **FurniturePiece** : **1..***
2. **FurniturePiece** -- **Composition** -- **Component** : **0..***
3. **Store** -- **Association** -- **Order** : **1..***
4. **Order** -- **Aggregation** -- **OrderItem** : **1..***
5. **OrderItem** -- **Association** -- **FurniturePiece** : **1**
