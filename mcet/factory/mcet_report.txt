[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not include a method for creating or managing purchase orders in the Client class, which is necessary for handling client interactions.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not include the concept of 'weight' for products, which is required according to the requirements.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not include the concept of 'material' for products in a way that indicates that products of the same type are produced from the same single material.
