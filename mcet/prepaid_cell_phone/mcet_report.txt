--- 3. DETECTED DESIGN ISSUES (Filtered) ---
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The Decorator class does not explicitly show how it aggregates charges from the Contract and the added options.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The relationship between Option and its subclasses (DataOption, SmsOption, MinutesOption, TransferRateOption) is described as inheritance, but it should be composition to align with the decorator pattern.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The ChargesCalculator class is mentioned but does not integrate with the Decorator pattern or the Contract class to calculate charges correctly.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The Contract class should have a mechanism to handle the addition of options and their respective charges, which is not clearly defined.
