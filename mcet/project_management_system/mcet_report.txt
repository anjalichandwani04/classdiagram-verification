[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not explicitly mention the concept of 'work products' as a general category that encompasses both requirements and systems, which is highlighted in the requirements.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design states that 'Requirements is a Work Product 1..1', but it should reflect that requirements can be validated in workshops with users, which is not captured in the design.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design lacks a clear representation of the project lifecycle stages (creation, initiation, termination) as described in the requirements.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not specify that the validation of work products is dependent on their type, as mentioned in the requirements.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not include the aspect of 'percent complete' for the project itself, which is implied in the requirements.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not address the potential for a project to be terminated for reasons other than completion, as stated in the requirements.
