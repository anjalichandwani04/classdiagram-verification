--- 3. DETECTED DESIGN ISSUES (Filtered) ---
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not specify that a captain must have an experience level of 3.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The Flight class associates a Co-Pilot as a separate class instead of using the Pilot class with a role distinction.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design lacks a mechanism to enforce the requirement of having at least one captain and one co-pilot for each flight.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The Aircraft class does not include a mechanism to differentiate between working and under repair states.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The design does not address the relationship between aircraft types and the specific roles required for pilots.
[ISSUE] Holistic Issue: The Pilot class does not explicitly mention the different roles (e.g., captain, co-pilot) that pilots can have.
[ISSUE] Diagram Contradiction: Flight Association Airport 2 - The requirement states that each flight has one departure and one arrival airport, not two.
[ISSUE] Diagram Contradiction: Pilot Association Experience Level 1 - The requirement states that experience levels are 1 to 3, not a direct association.
